Prerequisits: 
	- Git installed
	- Eclipse installed 
	  Add CDT and Photran to Eclipse
	  
1) set up msys2 64 bit http://www.msys2.org/ 
   - install as described above and update as described on the website above. This should always be done in the MSYS2 command prompt
   - add packages 
	base-devel , we actually need fortran and make. Not the complete toolchain
	mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
	
	finding a package. partial specification works
	pacman -Ss <name or part of the name of the package> 
	 
	e.g.: pacman -Ss x86_64-perl 
	
	we need perl for mkdep90 and mkdepmodul. they are perl scripts in bin
	
	installing a package
	pacman -S <name of the package>
	
     using  pacman --needed -Syu <packagename> 
     
     until done. The prompts will tell if something is todo.
     
     set MINGW_HOME to your installation of MSYS2\MINGW (the mingw64 diretory)
     In Eclipse  Preferences -> C/C++ -> Build -> Environment add Variable PATH:<msys64>\usr\bin (this makes it find your make)
     

creating a project in eclipse.
Create Fortran project Executable gnu fortran on windows
import file system 
select folder to import (the project folder)
folder to be set the same as source folder
advanced: create link. Tis should create a link to the src folder but without copying the files int the workspace, i.e. the files should not be linked!!
